# CMU Motion Capture Data — attribution & license

The `.bvh` files in this directory are from the **Carnegie Mellon University
Graphics Lab Motion Capture Database** (http://mocap.cs.cmu.edu/), via the
cgspeed Daz-friendly BVH conversion (Bruce Hahne), re-mirrored at
https://github.com/una-dinosauria/cmu-mocap .

## License — COMMERCIAL-SAFE ✓

Per the CMU database terms: *"This data is free for use in research projects.
You may include this data in commercially-sold products, but you may not resell
this data directly, even in converted form."*

i.e. we MAY ship motion retargeted from this data inside Fantasy Studio (a
commercial product). We may NOT sell the BVH data itself. This satisfies the
project's hard "free + commercial-safe only" constraint.

**Required acknowledgment** (must appear in product credits):
> "The motion data used in this product was obtained from mocap.cs.cmu.edu."

## NOT used: Bandai-Namco Research Motion Dataset

Considered but **excluded** — it is CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 (non-commercial,
no-derivatives), which violates the commercial-safe rule. Do not add it.
